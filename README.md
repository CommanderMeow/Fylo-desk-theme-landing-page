### Links

- Live Site URL: https://commandermeow.github.io/Fylo-desk-theme-landing-page/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

What have I learnt? I'm terrible when it comes to limiting what CSS I use so I don't repeat myself. It is definetly something I will be more aware of in the future as I have repeated myself far more then nessecary.



### Continued development

Along with trying to contain my CSS rambling habbit I need to work on my Javascipt. Although I only used a tiny amount in this project it is something that I need to improve on and hope to push in future projects!
